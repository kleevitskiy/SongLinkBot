Hi, I'm a simple bot to search for music. I use [Song.link](https://song.link/) and [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/)

You can talk to me in the following ways:

+ Press the button below and start typing a song, an album or an artist names

+ Add me to any chat and type my name @slsearchbot and start typing a song, an album or an artist names

+ Just send me a link to any song or album on almost any music service and I tell you where else it can be found

The following services are supported now:
+ [Yandex](https://music.yandex.ru/home)
+ [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/)
+ [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen)
+ [YouTube](https://youtube.com)
+ [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com)
